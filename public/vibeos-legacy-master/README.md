vibeOS is a JavaScript based Desktop Enviornment that runs in your browser. It can run applications made in JavaScript using our custom Constructor or load web applications with our WebView soulution. 

This repository contains the current source code for vibeOS. It does not need to be compiled, just extracted and `index.html` opened. It can also be deployed on a Web Server, for easy access. **vibeOS is entirely portable, requiring no server backend.**
